# google-pagerank-simulation
a simple script that allows you to generate a random internet network and get its pagerank vector. 

if the generated network is small enough (<30 websites), the script will also create a .png file with a representation of the network like these :
<img width="1980" height="1500" alt="graph 5 sommets v2 planar representation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2594d1e-f4b8-4bc6-85b3-335855b56478" />

<img width="1980" height="1500" alt="graph 10 nodes not planar randomly generated" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c275219f-1296-4643-870a-b35ba3b3ca29" />
